Hi, I'm ncw2004 and I am an undergraduate student! I intend to use this space as a portfolio for personal/school GIS and RStudio projects. I'm currently studying both biology and environmental science, with a specific interest in wildlife and habitat conservation. My pronouns are he/him, and I enjoy sports, hiking and spending time outdoors!
